## Environments

GlitchTip has kept track of environments (think staging, production, etc.) for awhile. 1.6 makes it easier to manage and filter issues based on environment over multiple projects.

<div style="width: 600px; max-width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;">
<video
    controls
    width="600"
    poster="/assets/blog-images/environments-demonstration.png"

    <source src="/assets/blog-images/environments-demonstration.mp4"
            type="video/mp4">
</video>
</div>

## Less is more

Did you know our main JavaScript bundle that loads in the browser is only 212kb gzipped? GlitchTip has the fastest load time among apps that are compatible with Sentry SDKs.

This reflects our values: we think that simplicity, speed, and being lightweight to run are important, and will continue to make these values a priority in our development. With that in mind, we reduced our Docker image size to just 123MB. Spend your time fixing bugs instead of waiting to see them.
