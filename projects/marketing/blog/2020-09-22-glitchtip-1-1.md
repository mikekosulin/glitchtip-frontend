## Social Authentication

            srcset="
                /assets/blog-images/glitchtip-1-1/social-2@1x.webp,
                /assets/blog-images/glitchtip-1-1/social-2@2x.webp 2x,
                /assets/blog-images/glitchtip-1-1/social-2@3x.webp 3x,
            "
        />
        <img

            srcset="
                /assets/blog-images/glitchtip-1-1/social-2@1x.png,
                /assets/blog-images/glitchtip-1-1/social-2@2x.png 2x,
                /assets/blog-images/glitchtip-1-1/social-2@3x.png 3x,
            "

</div>

While 1.0 had basic functionality, 1.1 revamped the system. Self-hosted users can configure Social Authentication providers in Django admin (see /admin). Only configured providers will show up as an option. All users, including hosted GlitchTip users, can add and remove social accounts from your profile. If you need to add another provider, submit a merge request implementing the frontend logic necessary to add it. We use django-allauth to help with this; make sure you do too.

## Notifications

            type="image/webp"
            srcset="
                /assets/blog-images/glitchtip-1-1/notifications-2@1x.webp,
                /assets/blog-images/glitchtip-1-1/notifications-2@2x.webp 2x,
                /assets/blog-images/glitchtip-1-1/notifications-2@3x.webp 3x,
            "
        />
        <img
            src="/assets/blog-images/glitchtip-1-1/notifications-2@1x.png"
            srcset="
                /assets/blog-images/glitchtip-1-1/notifications-2@1x.png,
                /assets/blog-images/glitchtip-1-1/notifications-2@2x.png 2x,
                /assets/blog-images/glitchtip-1-1/notifications-2@3x.png 3x,
            "
            loading="lazy"
            alt="Screenshot of GlitchTip's notification settings"
        />
    </picture>
</div>

1.0 had an issue notification system hidden away in Django admin. 1.1 provides a user interface for it. Now you can configure your projects to email you on every event or when the event quantity reaches a threshold.
