This release kicks off our documentation project and includes some quality of life features.

## Documentation

GlitchTip now shows inline "getting started" documentation when creating a new project. Our documentation is written in Markdown, and we plan to improve them over time to show more complete versions on our glitchtip.com website. If you are looking for a way to contribute, updating documentation is a good start.

## Connect GlitchTip to GitLab

GitLab lets you [integrate error tracking](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/error_tracking.html) so you can keep your errors closer to the rest of your workflow. GlitchTip can now integrate into GitLab this way. Generate the auth token in your profile ([link for people who aren't self-hosting](https://app.glitchtip.com/profile/auth-tokens)).

## Other improvements

- Environments are now fully supported in the backend.
- Searching based on tags (including environments) is now supported with the syntax `tag:value` in the issues search query. Frontend integration will be added soon to make this feature more obvious.
- The SaaS subscription page now shows total event count for the billing period. Self-hosted users may also find Django Admin organization event counts useful.
- We fixed several bugs related to null characters from the PHP client SDK.
- Some dependencies have been upgraded (Python to v3.9, Angular to v11).
- Rocket.Chat LiveChat can be enabled, intended to assist SaaS users.

## Support GlitchTip

GlitchTip is community-run, not funded by venture capital. We offer free, managed hosting up to 1000 events/month at cost. We strive to make self-hosting a first class option that's as easy to run as possible. If GlitchTip helps your project or organization, please consider supporting us.

- If you need hosting, use our [DigitalOcean referral link](https://m.do.co/c/7e90b8fb37f8) when signing up. This directly offsets the cost of our free hosting service.
- Donate via [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/GlitchTip/donate). If every self-host user donated $1/user/month we could hire full time developers for GlitchTip. Today we rely on volunteers and downtime between paid contract jobs.

## Whatâ€™s next

- Project roadmap
- More documentation
- Frontend work to give visibility to environments and search features
- UX user study

Longer term, we think uptime monitoring would be a great fit.
