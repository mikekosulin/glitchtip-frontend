## Uptime Monitoring

GlitchTip now supports TCP port monitoring and defaults to showing changes to uptime instead of all monitor checks (which can still be accessed). Monitor non-http assets such as a PostgreSQL server. Quickly view history of past disruptions.

## Group issues by fingerprint

GlitchTip now supports customized issue grouping by using the Sentry SDK's fingerprint feature.

```python
from sentry_sdk import push_scope, capture_exception

try:
    raise Exception
except Exception as err:
    with push_scope() as scope:
        scope.fingerprint = ["{{ default }}", "extra-foo"]
        capture_exception(err)
```

The default variable will keep the original grouping included. Omit it to define the grouping yourself. Any event with the same fingerprint array will be grouped together.

## Other improvements

- Prometheus metrics now supports a count of organizations and projects, thanks GitLab user @chassing
- We provide better defaults for celery to reduce memory creep. We now recommend setting CELERY_WORKER_AUTOSCALE: 1,3 for small instances (larger ones may want something like 2,10) and CELERY_WORKER_MAX_TASKS_PER_CHILD set to 10000. This helps release memory.
- Discord webhook support, thanks to GitLab user @ThallesP
- Added [PikaPods install](https://glitchtip.com/documentation/install#pikapods) documentation.

## In the Works

- Public status page for uptime monitoring
- Some [experimental work](https://gitlab.com/bufke/learn-rust/) was done using Rust to vastly lower system requirements. At this time, it's purely an experiment. But if you like writing Rust code, please reach out on [Gitter](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#GlitchTip_community:gitter.im).
