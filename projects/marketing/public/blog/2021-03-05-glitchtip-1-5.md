## Tag Stats

When your project logs an event, it will usually have a bunch of tags that will tell you things about the environment it was logged with: browser, operating system, release; that kind of thing. These events get grouped into issues, and now you can see an aggregated summary of all of the tag information to give you a much better sense of the scope of a problem.

## Routing

We refactored routing, so you'll notice that the URLs are a bit different. Your old URLs are now broken, but the new ones are more intuitive now, and it enabled us to clean up a lot of things in the codebase which will help us moving forward.

## Home Page

Our [app's home page](https://app.glitchtip.com) used to show a list of projects from the active organization only. Now, it shows all projects from all organizations, and the Projects link in the nav will be the more specific one.

## SDK updates

We're continuing to work to make sure that the open source Sentry SDKs work with GlitchTip. Between 1.4 and 1.5, we fixed some issues reported from Java- and Cocoa-based platforms, so hopefully those will work better for you.

Thank you to everyone who has reported issues here. We really appreciate it!

## Performance beta

In our 1.3 release, we mentioned that the open source Sentry SDKs support performance monitoring via tracing, and that we have preliminary support for them. We put the link in the nav now, so feel free to set it up and kick the tires on it.

Be aware that this uses a lot of events, so be careful with this. You can throttle it from your project if you want to try and strike that balance.
