## Dark mode

GlitchTip now allows users to run the app in dark mode. We are currently refining our dark theme to fix contrast and accessibility issues, so GlitchTip still defaults to light mode. In the future, GlitchTip will default to using your current system preference. But if you would like to try it for yourself in the meantime, you can switch to dark mode under your user profile. Our thanks go to GlitchTip contributor [@buttg](https://gitlab.com/buttg), who provided the initial work for dark mode and is currently helping to refine our dark theme.

## Other new features

- Reduced ram usage for celery worker and beat
- We've worked upstream with psycopg to address a significant [memory leak](https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg/issues/647). Thanks to Daniele from psycopg for fixing this so quickly!
- We've forked the archived [microsentry](https://gitlab.com/glitchtip/micro-sentry) project. This is a very lightweight alternative to @sentry/browser.

## Notice - Changes to OIDC and Keycloak

Keycloak must now be configured using OIDC. The django-allauth keycloak provider was removed. If you used this provider, then you need to configure it using the [OIDC provider](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/socialaccount/providers/openid_connect.html). Additionally, all django-allauth OIDC environment variables have been removed in favor of using Django Admin to manage configuration.
