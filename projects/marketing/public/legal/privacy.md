# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is critically important to us. At GlitchTip we have a few
fundamental principles:

- We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
- We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply
  with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
- We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required
  for the on-going operation of one of our services.

Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals.

If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data
please contact us at [privacy@mail.glitchtip.com](mailto:privacy@mail.glitchtip.com).
GlitchTip operates several websites including glitchtip.com. It is
GlitchTip’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we
may collect while operating our websites.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, GlitchTip collects non-personally-identifying
information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
and the date and time of each visitor request. GlitchTip’s purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
how GlitchTip’s visitors use its website. From time to time, GlitchTip may
release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

GlitchTip also collects potentially personally-identifying information
like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. GlitchTip does not use such
information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such
information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and
discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to GlitchTip’s websites choose to interact with GlitchTip
in ways that require GlitchTip to gather personally-identifying
information. The amount and type of information that GlitchTip gathers
depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who
sign up for an account at app.glitchtip.com to provide an email address.
Those who engage in transactions with GlitchTip are asked to provide
additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial
information required to process those transactions. In each case,
GlitchTip collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with
GlitchTip. GlitchTip does not disclose personally-identifying information
other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply
personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent
them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Use of personal data

GlitchTip may collect aggregated statistics about the behavior of visitors
to its websites. For instance, GlitchTip may monitor the most popular user
accounts on the platform. GlitchTip may display this information publicly
or provide it to others. In addition, GlitchTip may use your behavioral
data and other data you provide to GlitchTip to customize internal
advertisements on its platform to its users (for example, to offer you a
premium membership). However, GlitchTip does not disclose
personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

GlitchTip discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
information in order to process it on GlitchTip’ behalf or to provide
services available at GlitchTip’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not
to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and
affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
using GlitchTip’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such
information to them. GlitchTip will not rent or sell potentially
personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as
described above, GlitchTip discloses potentially personally-identifying
and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law,
or when GlitchTip believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably
necessary to protect the property or rights of GlitchTip, third parties or
the public at large. If you are a registered user of an GlitchTip website
and have supplied your email address, GlitchTip may occasionally send you
an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just
keep you up to date with what’s going on with GlitchTip and our products.
We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a
request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback
mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
GlitchTip takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the
unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Social Authentication

GlitchTip allows you to sign in with the following third-party services:
Google, Microsoft, GitHub, and GitLab. When you use them to sign in with our
hosted service at app.glitchtip.com, GlitchTip will store your username, name,
and email in order to make authentication work.

GlitchTip does not share this data with any third parties, nor will social
authentication add you to our newsletter or any marketing email. GlitchTip, if
configured to do so, will send notifications to your primary email address.

You can change and remove social authentication connections in your account's
Profile page.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time
the visitor returns. GlitchTip uses cookies to help GlitchTip identify and
track visitors, their usage of GlitchTip website, and their website access
preferences. GlitchTip visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on
their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using
GlitchTip’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of
GlitchTip’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Business Transfers

If GlitchTip, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the
unlikely event that GlitchTip goes out of business or enters bankruptcy,
user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or
acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur,
and that any acquirer of GlitchTip may continue to use your personal
information as set forth in this policy.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, GlitchTip may change its
Privacy Policy from time to time, and in GlitchTip’s sole discretion.
GlitchTip encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any
changes to its Privacy Policy.
